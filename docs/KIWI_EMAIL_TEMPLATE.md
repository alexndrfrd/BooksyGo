Dear Kiwi.com Affiliate Team,

My name is Alexandru Besleaga, and I'm the founder of BooksyGo, a new travel booking platform launching in Romania this month.

I'm reaching out to explore a potential affiliate partnership with Kiwi.com to integrate your flight search API into our platform.


🚀 ABOUT BOOKSYGO

BooksyGo is a modern, AI-powered travel platform that combines:
• Flight & Hotel Search
• Curated Travel Packages
• AI Travel Assistant (ChatGPT-style)
• Gamification (BooksyPoints rewards)
• Premium Concierge Services

We're targeting Romanian travelers (initial market) with plans to expand to Central/Eastern Europe within 12-18 months.


💡 WHY KIWI.COM?

After evaluating multiple flight API providers, Kiwi.com stands out for us because:
1. Startup-friendly affiliate model (no upfront API costs)
2. Strong coverage of European routes (our primary market)
3. Competitive pricing and transparent commission structure
4. Excellent documentation and developer support
5. Virtual Interlining technology (unique selling point)


📊 CURRENT STATUS & PROJECTIONS

• Platform Status: MVP completed, launching November 2025
• Tech Stack: Next.js (frontend), NestJS (backend), PostgreSQL
• Target Audience: Romanian millennials & Gen Z travelers (25-40 years)
• Initial Traffic Projection: 500-1,000 users in first 3 months
• Booking Projection: 50-100 bookings/month by Month 6
• Marketing Strategy: Social media, influencer partnerships, SEO

We understand we're a startup with no existing traffic yet, but we're committed to rapid growth and have a solid technical foundation ready to scale.


🎯 WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR

We'd like to integrate Kiwi.com's Tequila API to:
1. Display real-time flight search results
2. Generate affiliate links for bookings
3. Track conversions and optimize performance
4. Potentially explore deeper integration (booking flow) as we grow

We're flexible with partnership terms and understand commission-based models work best for early-stage startups.
