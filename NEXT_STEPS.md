## üí° Development Tips

### Start Simple
```typescript
// Don't start with this:
const results = await Promise.allSettled([
  skyscannerAPI.search(),
  amadeus.search(),
  kiwi.search()
]).then(parseAndMerge).then(cache).then(optimize);

// Start with this:
const results = await skyscannerAPI.search(params);
```

### Use Mock Data Initially
```typescript
// Create mock data for development
const MOCK_FLIGHTS = [
  {
    id: '1',
    origin: 'OTP',
    destination: 'BUD',
    price: 50,
    airline: 'Wizz Air',
    // ...
  }
];

// Toggle between mock and real API
const USE_MOCK = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development';
const flights = USE_MOCK ? MOCK_FLIGHTS : await api.search();
```

### Git Workflow
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/user-authentication

# Make changes, commit often
git add .
git commit -m "feat(auth): add user registration endpoint"

# Push to your fork
git push origin feature/user-authentication

# Create PR when ready
```

## üéâ Final Thoughts

**Remember**:
- Start small, iterate fast
- Don't over-engineer initially
